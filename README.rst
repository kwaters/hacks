marginal hacks
==============

A dumping ground for various sundry hacks.

To quote jwz,

  The following are mostly small utility scripts, rather than full-fledged
  applications. These are tools that I wrote for myself to fill a personal
  need.  This means that they are not necessarily very polished, but possibly
  you'll find some of them useful. Please take most them in the context of
  "one-hour hacks that have lived on far longer than expected."
