marginal hacks
==============

A dumping ground for various sundry hacks.

To quote jwz,

  The following are mostly small utility scripts, rather than full-fledged
  applications. These are tools that I wrote for myself to fill a personal
  need.  This means that they are not necessarily very polished, but possibly
  you'll find some of them useful. Please take most them in the context of
  "one-hour hacks that have lived on far longer than expected."

gb-logic-decoder
----------------

A frame decoder to parse the logic analyser dump from
http://flashingleds.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/intercepting-the-gameboy-lcd/.
Mostly an excuse to play with NumPy.
